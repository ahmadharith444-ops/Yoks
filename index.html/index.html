  <h2>Owl Species of Malaysia</h2>
  <p style="color:var(--muted);max-width:70ch;">
    Malaysia is home to a diverse range of owl species, each playing an important role in maintaining ecological balance. Below are nine owl species recorded in Malaysia, explained in a professional yet approachable manner to support education and public awareness.
  </p>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Barn Owl <em>(Tyto alba)</em></h3>
    <p>
      The Barn Owl is one of the most well-known owl species in Malaysia, particularly in agricultural landscapes such as oil palm plantations and rice fields. Its pale, heart-shaped facial disc and silent flight make it highly effective at hunting rodents in complete darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      This species has been widely adopted as a biological pest control agent, helping farmers reduce reliance on chemical pesticides. Barn Owls typically hunt small mammals, especially rats, making them economically valuable as well as ecologically important.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Fun fact:</strong> A single Barn Owl family can consume thousands of rodents in one breeding season.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Buffy Fish Owl <em>(Ketupa ketupu)</em></h3>
    <p>
      The Buffy Fish Owl is a large and powerful owl commonly associated with rivers, wetlands, and forested waterways. Unlike most owls, this species feeds extensively on fish, frogs, and other aquatic animals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its presence often indicates a healthy freshwater ecosystem. Because it relies on clean rivers and natural riverbanks, the Buffy Fish Owl is particularly vulnerable to water pollution and habitat disturbance.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Fun fact:</strong> This owl can catch live fish directly from the water using its strong talons.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Sunda Scops Owl <em>(Otus lempiji)</em></h3>
    <p>
      The Sunda Scops Owl is one of the most frequently heard owls in Malaysia, especially around villages, gardens, and forest edges. Although small in size, it is highly adaptable and comfortable living near human settlements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its simple, repetitive call is a familiar night sound across much of the country. The species mainly feeds on insects, making it an important natural controller of nocturnal pests.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Fun fact:</strong> Despite its tiny size, this owl can aggressively defend its territory from much larger birds.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Oriental Bay Owl <em>(Phodilus badius)</em></h3>
    <p>
      The Oriental Bay Owl is a secretive forest species known for its striking heart-shaped face and large dark eyes. It prefers dense lowland forests and shaded plantations, where it hunts quietly at night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Due to its elusive nature, this owl is rarely seen, and many people are unaware of its presence even in areas where it occurs.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Fun fact:</strong> Its soft, eerie call has earned it a reputation as one of the most mysterious owls in Southeast Asia.</p>
    <audio controls src="https://xeno-canto.org/sounds/uploaded/QKRSAXXQWS/XC635680-Oriental%20Bay%20Owl.mp3"></audio>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Brown Boobook <em>(Ninox scutulata)</em></h3>
    <p>
      The Brown Boobook is a small, agile owl commonly found in forests, plantations, and even urban parks. It is highly vocal and often detected by its repeated calls rather than by sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      This species feeds on insects, small mammals, and birds, demonstrating remarkable hunting flexibility across different habitats.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Fun fact:</strong> Brown Boobooks often return to the same perch night after night to call.</p>
    <audio controls src="https://xeno-canto.org/sounds/uploaded/SDPCHKOHRH/XC593417-Brown%20Boobook.mp3"></audio>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Brown Wood Owl <em>(Strix leptogrammica)</em></h3>
    <p>
      This large forest owl prefers mature forests with tall trees and minimal disturbance. It roosts high in dense canopy cover during the day and becomes active after sunset.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Brown Wood Owl’s deep hooting calls can travel long distances, making it an important acoustic presence in forest ecosystems.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Fun fact:</strong> Its eyes are adapted to low light, allowing it to detect prey in near-total darkness.</p>
    <audio controls src="https://xeno-canto.org/sounds/uploaded/VJYDFLJYQZ/XC560613-Brown%20Wood%20Owl.mp3"></audio>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Collared Scops Owl <em>(Otus lettia)</em></h3>
    <p>
      The Collared Scops Owl is rarely encountered in Malaysia and is known mainly through occasional records and calls. It inhabits forested landscapes and remains silent for long periods.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its limited visibility makes it a challenging species for researchers and birdwatchers alike.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Fun fact:</strong> Hearing this owl’s call is often considered a rare and memorable experience.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Barred Eagle-Owl <em>(Bubo sumatranus)</em></h3>
    <p>
      One of the largest owls in Malaysia, the Barred Eagle-Owl is a top nocturnal predator. It inhabits forest edges, woodlands, and occasionally areas close to human settlements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its powerful build allows it to prey on a wide range of animals, including mammals and other birds.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Fun fact:</strong> This owl’s call can be heard over several kilometres on quiet nights.</p>
    <audio controls src="https://xeno-canto.org/sounds/uploaded/VJYDFLJYQZ/XC531980-Barred%20Eagle-Owl.mp3"></audio>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Spotted Wood Owl <em>(Strix seloputo)</em></h3>
    <p>
      The Spotted Wood Owl is associated with forest margins and mixed landscapes. It is less tolerant of heavy disturbance and depends on connected forest habitats.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its deep, rhythmic calls are typically heard late at night and are characteristic of mature forest environments.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Fun fact:</strong> This species often forms long-term breeding pairs that return to the same territory each year.</p>

  <section id="conservation" class="card">
    <h2>Conservation in Malaysia</h2>
    <p>Owls play an important role in Malaysian ecosystems by controlling pest populations naturally. Habitat loss, deforestation, and monoculture farming threaten many owl species.</p>
    <p>Protecting forests, maintaining large trees, and using nest boxes in agricultural areas can help ensure owls continue to thrive alongside human development.</p>
